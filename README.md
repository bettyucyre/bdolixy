<p>Getting banned from Black Desert Online (BDO) can feel like getting hit by a giant crab boss—unexpected and painful. But don’t rage quit just yet! This simple guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal it for the best chance of getting your account back in the fight.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your ban stick to every new account you try to make, like a persistent shadow? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! This means BDO has flagged your PC hardware, making it tough to play even if you start fresh.</p>
