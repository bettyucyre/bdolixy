# How to Get Unbanned on BDO (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from Black Desert Online (BDO) can feel like getting hit by a giant crab boss—unexpected and painful. But don’t rage quit just yet! This simple guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal it for the best chance of getting your account back in the fight.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban stick to every new account you try to make, like a persistent shadow? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means BDO has flagged your PC hardware, making it tough to play even if you start fresh.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check all emails or messages from Pearl Abyss or the Black Desert support team to find out why. Common ban reasons include:
- Using cheats, hacks, or unauthorized third-party software
- Toxic or disruptive behavior in the community
- Account sharing or suspicious login activity

**Pro tip:** Always review the Pearl Abyss Terms of Service before you start drafting your appeal.
